			<p>Hello, I'm Nacho, a passionate technical game designer dedicated to infusing joy into people's lives through the magic of videogames. Fascinated by the human concept of "fun", its meaning and why it is important for us. I also like to explore its potential societal impact. Currently focused on continuous growth, I simultaneously delve into the realms of game design and programming.</p>

			<p>With a Bachelor's degree in videogame development and a Master's in game design, my journey spans the indie scene, small studio projects, and AAA experiences. Proficient in Unreal Engine 4 & 5 and Unity/C#, my key strengths lie in soft skills—effective teamwork, leadership, and project management.</p>

			<p>Beyond the gaming world, I maintain an active lifestyle, engaging in sports and gym activities. I'm initiating a podcast book club and have a deep love for boardgames. Since winning a Chinese NES clone in a raffle, my lifelong passion for gaming has evolved from consoles to PC, with a penchant for social play, action, strategy, RPGs, and a decade-long affinity for indie games and roguelikes.</p>

			<p>Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities at the intersection of technology, creativity, and fun!</p>


			<!-- 
			<p> Over twenty years ago I won a Chinese NES clone console in a raffle, to this day, I have not stopped thinking of anything other than videogames.
				Many gamedevs compelling stories tell how they started programming at 12 years old and how they were sucked into the world of development naturally.
				This is not that story, mine is a story of struggling against the people who told me that this is not a real job and should do anything else. 
				Living up to other people's expectations brought me to three college drop-outs and a depression. Finally, I understood that nobody could live for me and
				stood up. Got back again to University even though I was "too old" to start again and finish my studies, this time on something I felt right, videogames.  	
			</p>
			<p> Now I am set in the quest of unravel every inch of the mystery behind the curtain. I am hungry for learning every aspect of game making and the more I learn, 
				the more clear my path is, Game design and programming are my weapons of choice.    </p>
