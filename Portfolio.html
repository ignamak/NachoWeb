											A rapidly growing studio in which I had to wear various hats. As game designer I have done game proposals for potential clients, initial documentation and then full documents.
											Designed modding tools, the core systems for a social multiplayer game, puzzle system for an adveture-puzzle game and then move to my preferred position of Technical design in the Lords of the Fallen game as Boss-combat designer.
											Other tasks included CV reviewing and interviewing for design positions alongside with junior mentorship once they joined us.

										<!-- <p>Done in the context of my Master's Degree in Game Design, Blackstorm is the biggest and most ambitious project I've worked on. 
											The game is a Battle Royale focused on cooperative teamplay, features unique mechanics like multiple gravities in an online game and three axis space navigation.
											  Being part of an interdisciplinary 18 people team taught me how to work in a bigger project where many things are out of your reach.
											  My role within the team was technical design, documentation writing, and system and mechanics design and prototyping. 
											  We are still working on it and we aim to launch the game for free.  <br /> -->

											My first game ever published, I did it as it was simple enough to take on by myself and finish it.
											Through the process I learnt how difficult is to keep motivation working alone, set goals and stablish an MVP.

											<!--  OLD TEXT
											After DeckDungeon I came up one day with a simple minigolf game idea. 
											Instead of being given a level and you have to calibrate your shot to get the ball inside the cuphole, you are given an empty level and you place the obstacles. 
											Thus as more obstacles the ball hits the bigger score you obtain.

											<h3>Bambo Studio</h3>
											<p>2017 - Unity / C# </p>
										</header>
										<p>A two months internship in a small mobile company. 
											During my time at Bambo Studio, I made a small patch for an existing game that allowed the game to store locally data, load it afterwards, a tournament game mode and some visual updates. 
											Here I learnt how a small office runs and made some friends.</p>
